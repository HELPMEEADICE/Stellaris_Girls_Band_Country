 origin_kirakira: "Fleeting Starbloom"
 origin_kirakira_desc: "In the vast, silent epic of the universe measured in eons, an unknown miracle once occurred. It was not the violent destruction of a supernova, nor the greedy consumption of a black hole, but a star with a dream, performing a once-in-a-lifetime 'Stellar Solo' for its own existence.\nIt grew weary of eternal burning, unwilling to exhaust its light and heat under the cold grip of gravity. Thus, it gathered all its life, all its memory, and all its yearning for 'Sparkling Heart-Pounding,' condensing it into a fleeting instant. In that moment, it did not explode, but bloomed like a flower bud in full, becoming a cosmic blossom of pure light and emotion that spanned several galaxies. Within that light were the joy of birth, the trials of growth, the thrill of encounters, and the sorrow of farewells. It was a silent symphony, a final, resolute, and magnificent Live performance dedicated to the void.\nWhen the radiance faded and the star was no more, its song—that ultimate, life-burning 'Kirakira Dokidoki'—did not vanish. It transformed into countless shimmering motes of stardust, like undying musical notes, merging into the surrounding nebula and seeding a dream of 'the fleeting moment as eternity.'\n\nTheir civilization was born amidst the nebula blessed by this 'Fleeting Starbloom.' The most primordial life came into being, bathed in the lingering afterglow of that starlight. Deep within their genes, an instinctual yearning to 'bloom' was innate, and in their souls flowed a profound reverence for the 'moment.' Life is transient, like a meteor streaking across the night sky, but they firmly believe that precisely because of its brevity, one must strive with all their might to make that single instant's brilliance illuminate the entire cosmos.\nThey do not seek eternal empires, nor do they covet immortal life. To them, the entire existence of their civilization is a grand, limited-time Live Show. Each generation's birth and passing is a movement in the symphony; each technological breakthrough is to make the stage effects more spectacular; each encounter with other civilizations is a search for new 'co-stars' and an 'audience'.\nTheir state policies are their 'setlist'. Their exploration fleets are searching for the perfect 'stage' for the next 'tour'. Their diplomats are inviting the friends of the universe to join this grand carnival with their most sincere 'songs'.\nThey carry the will of the 'Fleeting Starbloom', using their finite lives as a plectrum and the galaxy as their strings, to pursue and recreate that cosmic, ultimate performance. They want the entire universe to understand: the most profound emotions do not come from eternal stillness, but from that one-of-a-kind, reckless, and passionately burning—\n\n§YFleeting Starbloom§!"
