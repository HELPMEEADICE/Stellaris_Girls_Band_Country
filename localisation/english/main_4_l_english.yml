Hello everyone, this is 'The Great Girls' Band Nation'—an interstellar federation born from music, singing for dreams!\"\n\nThbirth of 'The Great Girls' Band Nation' stemmed from a group of girls' purest love for music and their boundless aspirations for the future. They believe that music possesses a power that transcends all barriers, capable of conveying emotions, uniting hearts, and even enlightening civilizations. This conviction became the core driving force of the entire nation. Their ultimate goal is to deliver this 'Sparkling Heart-Pounding' experience, through songs, melodies, and stages, to every life form in the universe, filling the entire galaxy with laughter and harmony.\n\nThe society of 'The Great Girls' Band Nation' is brimming with vitality and creativity. Music is the universal language and also one of the important standards for measuring value. Children receive musical edification from a young age, and forming bands is the most popular activity among teenagers. Cities shimmer with neon lights, and live houses, musical instrument stores, and scenes of fan support are ubiquitous. Technological development also closely revolves around music, such as interstellar communication systems that can perfectly replicate live sound effects, and stage technology that can transform emotions into visual effects.\n\nEven a nation filled with 'Sparkling Heart-Pounding' will face challenges: 'factional disputes' arising from different musical philosophies among federal members (such as friendly debates between the 'Rock Supremacy' faction and the 'Pop Royalty' faction), how to translate musical ideals into practical effectiveness in handling complex interstellar affairs, and how to respond to truly malevolent cosmic threats that cannot be swayed by music.\n\nBut the girls of 'The Great Girls' Band Nation' and their citizens firmly believe that as long as the 'flame of music' in their hearts does not extinguish, and as long as the 'bonds' between partners remain, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome. Their songs will continue to echo through the sea of stars, composing an unceasing youthful movement that belongs to them, and also to the entire universe!"
